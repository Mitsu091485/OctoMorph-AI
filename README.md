# OctoMorph-AI
OctaMorph AI is the first adaptive ERC-4626 vault that learns how to allocate yield dynamically between DeFi strategies and fund public goods proportionally to real-time impact metrics. Instead of locking into one yield source (like Aave or Lido), OctaMorph continuously morphs its portfolio composition using AI-driven on-chain intelligence.
